# BookShoppingCartMvc (A basic e-comm system for beginners)📚🛒

It is a source code of the youtube tutorial on [book shopping cart in .net core mvc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4ZLWD89R5w&list=PLP8UhDwXI7f_8r2Rbt7GNwf7eXZqUu_p4). Initially it was designed to explain how shopping cart 🛒 works in dot net core mvc. But now it has more features except payment gateway. A ⭐ in repository is highly appreciated, helps to promote my content.

📢 Initially , this project was built with .net 7. But it is **Upgraded to .net 9.0.** now and I will try to keep it up to date.

## Tech stack 🧑‍💻

- Dotnet core mvc (.Net 9)
- MS SQLServer 2022 (Database)
- Entity Framework Core (ORM) (For Authentication)
- Dapper (ORM) (For rest of the app)
- Identity Core (Authentication)
- Bootstrap 5 (frontend)

## Tools I have used and their alternative

- Visual Studio 2022 (Alternatives (.NET SDK + VS Code or .NET SDK + JetBrains Rider)
- Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio (Alternative Azure data studio or you can just execute sql from terminal)

Note: Every tool and tech is free for personal use.
